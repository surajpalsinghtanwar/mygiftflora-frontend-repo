The file /my-nextjs-app/my-nextjs-app/public/favicon.ico should contain the binary data for the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary data directly, please ensure you have a favicon image ready. You can create or download a favicon.ico file and place it in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific favicon, you can create a simple one using an online favicon generator or design software.
